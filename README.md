# tufte-crossref-jekyll

This is a Jekyll theme for using Tufte CSS alongside `pandoc-sidenote`. It's
based off of

- [Tufte CSS] for the original CSS file
- [Tufte Pandoc CSS] uses Markdown in conjunction with Tufte CSS

[Tufte CSS]: https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/
[Tufte Pandoc CSS]: https://jez.io/tufte-pandoc-css/

You may ask, "What's the difference between this and `tufte-jekyll`?"

Using `pandoc-sidenote`, we don't have to use `{% sidenote %}...{% sidenote %}`
and can instead just use `[^1]` like normal Pandoc markdown.

For a demo, see <https://jez.io/talks/>.

## Features specific to tufte-crossref-jekyll

This fork introduces some changes to the style sheets that are meant to
provide support for using **tufte-pandoc-jekyll** alongside
[Pandoc-crossref]. Otherwise, this project attempts to
match the style, features, and version numbering of
**tufte-pandoc-jekyll**. In short what it does is to:

[Pandoc-crossref]: https://lierdakil.github.io/pandoc-crossref/

<!--[Reveal.js]: https://revealjs.com-->

### Figures, captions, and borders ###

- Provide basic support for pandoc-crossref subfigures.
- Correctly style `<figcaption>` even in margin figures, as generated by
  pandoc-crossref.
- Correctly style `div > table > caption` as generated by
  pandoc-crossref.
- Match table border color to main text color and collapse to avoid gaps
  and other rendering issues.
- Basic support for full-width iframes and for treating iframes as
  figures with captions, by using pandoc-crossref `.subfigures` syntax
  (results may be unexpected in some cases).
- Make `<video>` behave the same as `<img>`.

### Alignments and typography ###

- Fix the alignment of sidenotes generated by Citeproc citations inside
  Blockquotes.
- Fix the width of definition lists that are inside an
  ordered or unordered list.
- Style `<h5>`, `<h6>`, and `<dt>` to match `<span class="newthought">`;
  the rationale behind this is that a `span` provides no semantic
  structure to the document, whereas using headings follows the concept
  of run-in `\paragraph` and `\subparagraph` in LaTeX.
- Style Pandoc's `.line-block` (blocks where line breaks are preserved
  as-is, for example in poetry) to be consistent with the remainder of
  the text.
- Emphasized text belonging to a block that is in italics by default
  (epigraphs and level 2 and 3 headings) is made upright.
- Use the OpenType `font-variant: all-small-caps` for text using
  the default Pandoc span class `{.smallcaps}`.
- Use the OpenType `font-variant: tabular-nums` inside table cells.
- Flush table cell contents top even if the cell has a `<p>` in it,
  while preserving spaces between paragraphs.
- Pull the CSL styling already implemented in Tufte-Pandoc-CSS but not
  yet migrated to tufte-pandoc-jekyll.

   -### Reveal.js and bonus features ###
   -
   -The following tweaks allow you to use the same Markdown file as a base
   -for a regular web page and for a Reveal.js slideshow. These features are
   -not enabled by default. To enable then, check out `assets/css/main.scss`
   -from the theme files and uncomment the `@import "revealjs-support" ;`
   -line.
   -
   -- Provide basic support for Reveal.js columns (only two equal or unequal
   -  columns work well for now; for further details, see the
   -  [Pandoc docs](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#columns)).
   -- Correct the width of *speaker notes* and *incremental* blocks used by
   -  Reveal.js to match that of regular paragraph text.
   -- Enable support for collapsible `<details>` blocks.
   -- Provide a dark color scheme based on a softened inversion of the main
   -  colors as well as the solarized dark scheme for code.
