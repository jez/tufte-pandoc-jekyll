# tufte-pandoc-jekyll

This is a Jekyll theme for using Tufte CSS alongside `pandoc-sidenote`. It's
based off of

- [Tufte CSS] for the original CSS file
- [Tufte Pandoc CSS] uses Markdown in conjunction with Tufte CSS

[Tufte CSS]: https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/
[Tufte Pandoc CSS]: https://jez.io/tufte-pandoc-css/

You may ask, "What's the difference between this and `tufte-jekyll`?"

Using `pandoc-sidenote`, we don't have to use `{% sidenote %}...{% sidenote%}`
and can instead just use `[^1]` like normal Pandoc markdown.

For a demo, see `https://jez.io/talks`.

## Installation

There are two external dependencies in order to use this theme. You can install
them through your package manager (like `apt-get` or `brew`):

```
# EXAMPLE: This is for macOS. Change if you're on Linux.
brew install pandoc
brew install jez/formulae/pandoc-sidenote
```

Next, add this line to your Jekyll site's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "tufte-pandoc-jekyll"
```

And add these lines to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: tufte-pandoc-jekyll

gems:
  - jekyll-pandoc
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tufte-pandoc-jekyll


## Usage

> Note: while `tufte-pandoc-css` optionally includes the Solarized Light
> colorscheme, it's enabled by default here, with no easy way to opt-out. This is
> probably fine for you, but if it's not, feel free to make a PR that allows
> opting out.
